Autonomouse
===========

[_I can send an IP packet to Europe faster than I can send a pixel to the screen. How fâ€™d up is that?_] (https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/193480622533120001)

Autonomouse is an input latency test rig for measuring the latency between a click and a pixel changing on the screen. We use simple Arduino-based hardware costing ~$50 that sends clicks via Bluetooth and measures the time until a custom photosensor registers a pixel has changed.
